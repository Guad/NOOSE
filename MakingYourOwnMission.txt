# Introduction
It's very easy to make and add missions to NOOSE mod. I included a coordinate recorder activated by NumPad Dot (Decimal) which will create a file in NOOSEMissions\Coordinates.txt
The missions have a XML syntax. All of the elements must be wrapped in a root tag, <Mission></Mission>.
Then we have 4 elements inside: MetaInfo, EntryPoints, Enemies and DecorativeVehicles.

# MetaInfo
This is the section which contains data about the mission itself (metadata).
Things like
* Name
* Info
* Enabled (true/false)
* CameraPos - defines the camera position when selecting the missions.
* RequiredIPL - if your mission needs any IPL to load. This is optional.
<RequiredIPL>
	<IPL remove="true">cargoboat</IPL> <- This IPL will be removed while the mission is active, and then re-added when the mission ends.
	<IPL>anotherOne</IPL>
</RequiredIPL>
* Area - a polygon defining the combat area of your mission. This is optional. It has a list of Point tags with x and y attributes, they define the polygon vertices.
Try to keep the polygon as simple as possible.
<Area>
	<Point x="121" y="1521"/>
	<Point x="124" y="4124"/>
	<Point x="121" y="1521"/>
	<Point x="124" y="4124"/>
</Area>

# EntryPoints
This section defines the entry points of the mission. You can have as many entry points as you want.
There are 3 types of entry points:
 - teleport: Instantly teleports the player to the coordinates.
 - rappel: Player spawns in a helicopter and then flies to the coordinates and rappels down.
 - plane: Player spawns in a plane and gets flown to the destination, landing the plane.
Every type has their own arguments but they all share one: the Name.

# teleport EntryPoint
- Name
- Position with x,y,z and heading attributes
<EntryPoint type="teleport">
  <Name>Front</Name>
  <Position x="81.6684" y="3596.262" z="39.72292" heading="5.505774"/>
</EntryPoint>

# rappel EntryPoint
- Name
- Destination (of the helicopter)
- Helipad with attributes x,y,z
<EntryPoint type="rappel">
    <Name>Helicopter</Name>
	<Helipad x="1770.297" y="3238.947" z="41.6537"/>
    <Destination x="-23.28014" y="3666.868" z="54.55974"/>
</EntryPoint>

# plane EntryPoint
- Name
- PlaneSpawn: has attributes x,y,z, this is where the plane spawns.
- PlaneHeading: plane heading when it spawns.
- Approach: x,y,z of the position where the landing begins. This is generally in front of the airport, high in the air.
- RunwayStart: start of the runway.
- RunwayEnd: end of the runway. If the pilot overflies the runway, make the RunwayEnd in the middle of your runway.
<EntryPoint type="plane">
	<Name>Plane</Name>
	<PlaneSpawn x="1775.372" y="3275.426" z="41.18471"/>
	<PlaneHeading>180</PlaneHeading>
	<Approach x="1775.372" y="3275.426" z="41.18471"/>
	<RunwayStart x="1775.372" y="3275.426" z="41.18471"/>
	<RunwayEnd x="1775.372" y="3275.426" z="41.18471"/>
</EntryPoint>

# Enemies
This is where you define your enemies. Each line represents one enemy and has attributes x,y,z, and heading.
By default, the mod will load all of your enemies. If you set a "max" attribute to Enemies, it will pick a random unique spawnpoint and create an enemy until it reaches that number.
If you set it to "random", the mod will choose that number between maxpositions/2 and maxpositions.
<Enemies max="1">
	<Enemy x="96.46419" y="3750.036" z="40.71968" heading="70.04143"/>
</Enemies>

# Bomb Defusal Gamemode
This section is completely optional. It defines the spawnpoints for the bomb in the Bomb Defusal gamemode. First define a list Bombs with a "time" attribute, which will define the bomb countdown in seconds.
Then add spawnpoints inside with x,y,z and heading attributes. One will be chosen at random every round.
<Bombs time="120">
	<Bomb x="2141" y="1241" z="1512" heading="2412"/>
	<Bomb x="2141" y="1241" z="1512" heading="2412"/>
	<Bomb x="2141" y="1241" z="1512" heading="2412"/>
</Bombs>

# DecorativeVehicles
This section is optional, but you have to include it, even if empty. Defines empty vehicles to spawn in the world.
The spawn attribute indicates whether to spawn always (-1) or when the player chooses a specific entry point (0,1,2, etc).

This vehicle will always spawn:
<Vehicle model="Police" x="7.751782" y="3601.629" z="40.11242" heading="174.1431" spawn="-1"/>

This vehicle will only spawn when the player chooses the first entry point:
<Vehicle model="Dinghy2" x="181.5672" y="3660.32" z="30.12024" heading="45.93738" spawn="0"/>

There are also optional attributes for your vehicles:
- siren: true/false whether the siren should be on
- doors: bitmask for which doors to open. the order is left-front, right-front, left-rear, right-rear
	ex: "0011" would open the back doors, "1010" would open left doors and "1111" would open all doors.

See BikersHideout.xml for an example reference.
